# Restaurant Ordering App

## Description
The "Restaurant Ordering App" is a solo project by Scrimba Front-end Program designed to apply the JavaScript concepts I've learned in a real-world scenario. In this app, users can browse a menu, add or remove meals to their cart, and proceed to place an order using dummy credit card information. Upon order confirmation, a message informs the user that their order is on the way, and they can notify the app when the order is received.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Learnings
- Developed a user-friendly interface for meal selection and cart management.
- Implemented an order system that simulates payment and order processing.
- Managed state within the app to keep track of user selections and orders.
- Displayed dynamic feedback messages to enhance user interaction.
